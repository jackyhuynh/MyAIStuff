## Python, R for Data Science, AI/ML Tools:

Here are some essential Python libraries used in data science, AI, and machine learning that you may need:

- **[Python 3 Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)**: Documentation for built-in Python features.
- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html)**: A library for numerical computations with arrays.
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)**: A powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis.
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/index.html)**: A popular plotting library for creating static and
  interactive visualizations.
- **[R](https://www.r-project.org/)**: Free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
- **[RStudio IDE](https://rstudio.com/)**: Integrated development environment (IDE) for R with powerful tools for
  plotting, debugging, and workspace management.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application for creating and sharing live code, visualizations, and narrative
  text.
- **[Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/)**: A desktop GUI for managing data
  science environments and packages for Python and R without using the command line.
- **[Install R](https://www.r-project.org/)** - Download and install R from the official website.
- **[Install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#:~:text=RStudio%20Take%20control%20of%20your%20R%20code)** -
  Download the free version of RStudio Desktop.
- *
  *[Install Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/#:~:text=Installing%20Navigator%20Navigator%20is%20automatically%20installed%20when%20you)
  ** - Use Anaconda Navigator to set up Python for data science projects.
