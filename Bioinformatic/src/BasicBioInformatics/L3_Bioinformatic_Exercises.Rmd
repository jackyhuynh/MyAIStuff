```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
 
## Objectives:

- Explore features of the R programming languages
- Use objects, functions, and data structures.


## Question 1:

Create a sequence of random numbers from 25 to 60 and print their average.

### Answer:

```{r seq}
# Create a sequence from 25 to 60 with 20 values.
# use the mean () function to calculate the average
mean(runif(n = 20, min = 25, max = 60))
```

## Question 2:

Create a vector which contains 25 random integer values between -20 and +20 and display the sum of only the negative numbers among them.

### Answer:

```{r vector}

# sequence with 25 values using the sample function.
sequence = sample(-20:20, 25, replace = TRUE);

# collect the negative number in the list
negativeSeq = sequence[sequence<0];

# sum all the negative number using sum () function
sum(negativeSeq)
```

## Question 3:

Create four vectors a,b,c,d with 3 integers each. Combine the vectors to form a matrix where each column represents a vector. Print the size of the matrix as well as its contents.

### Answer:

#### Matrix create and dimension:

The matrix content is:

```{r matrix}
# Create four vectors a,b,c,d with 3 integers each
a = c(1,2,3)
b = c(4,5,6)
c = c(7,8,9)
d = c(10,11,12)

# Combine the vectors using the r base data.frame() funcyion
matrix_ <- matrix(c(a,b,c,d),3,4)


# Display the dimension of the vector using the dim() function
dim(matrix_)
```

#### Matrix content:

The draw data is:

```{r matrix_content}
# display the matrix content
matrix_

```

## Question 4:

Create a Data frame to store at least 4 details of 5 employees. Name each row with the employees last name. Print the contents of the Data fame as well as its dimensions.

### Answer:

```{r employee_data}
# employee id
id = c(1,2,3,4,5)

# employee full name
name = c('Truc Huynh', 'Kristina Bond', 'Wrachu Nata', 'Jenny Nguyen', 'James Bond')

# employee phone number
phone = c(1112220000,2223330000,4445550000,6667770000,7778880000)

# manager
manager = c('yes','no','no','no','no')

# create matrix Employee
matrixEmployee <- data.frame(id, name, phone, manager)
```

### Print Matrix Employee:
  
  The raw data is:

```{r print_employee_matrix}
# print the content of matrixEmployee
matrixEmployee
```

### Employee data frame size:

  The dimension of the matrix is:

```{r }
# get dimension of matrixEmployee
dim(matrixEmployee)
```

## Question 5:

Define a function to find common elements from two vectors and return the result as a third vector. Test your function using at least three different sample inputs.

### Answer:

```{r common_element}

# create function common_element
# input: 2 vector of different size
# output: vector of common elements, return NULL if no common element

common_element <- function(x,y){
  
  # the intersect base R return the common element between 2 vectors
  z <- intersect(x, y)

  return (z)
}


```

### Test 1:

  Test 1 is satisfied with integer and repeated number. Please note number 9 was repeated 2 times in both vector.
  
```{r common_element_test1}

# test integer
common_element(
  c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9),
  c(8,9,11,12,12,13,14,9))

```

### Test 2:

  Test 2 is satisfied with characters and repeated chars. Please note char 'T' was repeated 2 times in both vector.Please notify the upper and lower chars is sensitive and mark as different.
  
```{r common_element_test2}

# test chars, string
common_element( 
  c('T','b','c','d','Y','t','u','We will','it','none','cv','bl'),
  c('t','T','T','t','q','U','c','T','D','d','A','T','We will','rock','it',"none"))

``` 

### Test 3:

  Test 3 is satisfied with combine of integer and characters. All the combine was based on the rules of chars combine (test 2) and integer combine (test 1)

```{r common_element_test3}

# test chars, string, integer, and float
common_element(
  c('T','b','c',11,12,54,67,'d','Y','t','u',1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9,1.1,3.4,7.99,'t','u','We will','it','none','cv','bl'),
  c('t','T','T','t','q','U','c','T','D','d','A','T',8,9,11,12,12,'rock','it',"none",13,14,9,7.999,7.99))


```
