    "4. Replace the 'ands' with 'ors' and discuss how the program executes now: Well if we add the or program will not run correctly. We are now encounter a logic error. For example in the 1st if statement, if user enter BLUE or YELLOW, the app will ignore them. it will still print out the invalid satatement eventhough the BLUE and GREEN is valid. The reason is the 'or' statement just make the print statement execute because it satisied the condition color is not 'RED'."
