# Agent Based

## Agent Require:

- The ability I am done -> goal-based: for an AI is something the machine already know.
  The goal is to do the tax according to the rules. ()-> The agent is looking for the lowest number
  that agent possibly can make -> Tax is Utility based agent. Example: If we have competing goals, say low taxes and
  probability of getting audited, would that require a utility-based agent?

- Model-Based is complex form of Simple Reflex
- Goal-Based is stopped by reach the goal
- Utility-Based goal is choose between options

- Example 2:
    - What is the minimum agent required to build a robot to vacuum your home?
    - I choose Goal-based to make sure it clean (cover every inch of the house). The tools in this case is what you can
      make. Track that I cover every square inch.
    - Model-based is like simple-reflex except with a memory of past action
    - if the vac bot remembers where it has been and does something with that memory it is sequential
      if it does nothing or has not memory it is episodic

## Agent type:

- Simple Reflex Agent
- Model-based agent
- Utility-based agent
- Goal-based agent
- Learning Agent

Minimum agent:

- Performance:
    - point at certain location. Criteria where the range of the heat.
    - Align the position of the mirror
    - Tracking the position of the sun
- Environment:
    - Partially Observable
    - Multi-agent
    - Stochastic
    - Dynamic
    - Continuous
